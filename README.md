# Architecture
Microservices Architecture in Node JS and Typescript.

Description:
- As a collection of small independent and loosely coupled services.
- Each service focus on a single feature
- Can be developed and deployed independently
- Faster development
- Better fault isolation
- Can use different programming language for each service.
- New feature can be added easily without affecting whole application.

## Getting started

The command below will install all node_modules, link required packages and start the application in the respective microservices folder.

`npm install && npm run build`
